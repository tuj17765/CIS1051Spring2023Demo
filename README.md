### Challenges Faced

Creating the login/signup feature for our website was definitely one of the biggest challenges we faced. We especially had difficultly figuring out how to store all the data for later use, where we could allow users to create accounts, log in, store their clothing items, and then logout. It was a learning curve, and we spent extra time researching and testing different approaches to make it work seamlessly. We tried various methods, such as ... but ultimately, we were able use ... to handle the process. 

Another difficulty we faced during the development of the website was not being able to bring our entire idea to life. We had many ideas, such as allowing users to like or dislike outfits that were generated or being able to generate outfits based on the weather. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and overall limitations, we had to scale back our plans. 

### What we Learned/Enjoyed

This project was an excellent opportunity to expand our knowledge and learn more about different programming languages. We started with HTML, which was fairly simple to understand. However, as we further developed the website to add interactivity, we had to learn more about JavaScript and Flask, which was a bit more challenging. We were also able to learn more about CSS to style and website and make it more appealing by customizing a template to speed up the process. We found that working with these new languages allowed us to think about programming in new ways and learn new syntax. We were able to gain a better understanding of what it takes to build a simple website, and that was very rewarding to see. Although we had to cut some of our ideas, we were able to enjoy our work take shape.
