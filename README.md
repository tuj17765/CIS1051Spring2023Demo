### Challenges Faced

Creating the login/signup feature for our website was definitely one of the biggest challenges we faced. We especially had difficultly figuring out how to store all the data for later use, where we could allow users to create accounts, log in, store their clothing items, and then logout. It was a learning curve, and we spent extra time researching and testing different approaches to make it work seamlessly. We tried various methods, such as using FlaskForm to verify user information but ultimately, we were able use the Flask LoginManager to handle the process. Our major roadblock here was to find a way to connect the SQLite/SQLAlchemy database with the Flask server that we had the website running on. As this was our first time learning so many new concepts (HTML, CSS, Flask, SQLite etc.) and configuring/installing packages and software, it took a while to get the webiste to a working condition. As such, our results were limited, but once we were able to get past the database connection, it became significantly easier. A little more time would have gone a long way.

Another difficulty we faced during the development of the website was not being able to bring our entire idea to life. We were not able to complete the add item/add closet process, or display the closets and items that were inputted by the user. We had many ideas, such as allowing users to like or dislike outfits that were generated or being able to generate outfits based on the weather. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and overall limitations, we had to scale back our plans. 

### What we Learned/Enjoyed

This project was an excellent opportunity to expand our knowledge and learn more about different programming languages. We started with HTML, which was fairly simple to understand. However, as we further developed the website to add interactivity, we had to learn more about JavaScript and Flask, which was a bit more challenging. We were also able to learn more about CSS to style and website and make it more appealing by customizing a template to speed up the process. We found that working with these new languages allowed us to think about programming in new ways and learn new syntax. We were able to gain a better understanding of what it takes to build a simple website, and that was very rewarding to see. Although we had to cut some of our ideas, we were able to enjoy our work take shape.
