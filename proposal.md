# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

OOTD: Online Closet - Outfit Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website/app that lets you upload pictures of items from your closet and sorts those items based on criteria like the weather or number of times worn. It also generates outfit ideas based on specified criteria. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This website/app will allow the user to upload pictures of items of clothing from their closet and then tag them with different descriptors from the drop down. This project will generate outfits that users can like or dislike (to generate another outfit) and then save those outfits to "closets" that the user creates (ex: Work, Date Night, Europe Trip). It can also sort items by number of items worn, fabrics, styles, etc. and generate outfits based on the weather (location inputted by the user).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Allowing the user to upload images and save images to certain "closets"/files.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition, being able to add tags/descriptors to images and then having the system sort items based on those images.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition, adding a feature close to a weather widget, having the system generate recommendations based on tags or other descriptors such as style or event.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To develop this website, we would start by identifying the components that would be required, including: creating a website that stores user data, a function for the user to upload images, a tagging system that allows the user to assign different descriptors to items, an algorithm that takes in account different criteria like weather, and a way for the user to create and save their own closets. 

We would need to acquire a development of other languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We would also need to learn frameworks in Python and SQL. We would also need to research various APIs that would provide weather data based on location. 

We would like to divide our tasks based on individual strengths, where one person can be responsible for the front-end design, while another can focus on the database management. However, we would both work together to ensure all components of the project are working properly.
