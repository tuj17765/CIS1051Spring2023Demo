Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, we have been able to design a rough mock-up of what the website should look like, lay out the organization of web pages, and determine how they should function. We have been able to generate login/signup pages and establish a way for users to upload images and enter information.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need to finish building and designing the web pages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also need to find a way to save the data into a database for future use.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Our biggest problem is finding an effective way to save data without it becoming too complicated. For now, our plan is to use Flask and MySQL to do so.
